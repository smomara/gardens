        <h1>Sex Without Purpose</h1>
<p>Physical intimacy has <a href="twin-purpose.html">two fundamental purposes</a> that work in harmony:
the creation of new life and the forging of deep bonds between partners.
These aren't separate ends but deeply interconnected ones.
The possibility of creating life naturally orients partners toward commitment and unity.
And this unity, in turn, creates creates the
stable foundation needed for raising children.
When both purposes are honored,
intimate relationships reach their full meaning and potential.</p>
<p>But modern innovations have severed these connected purposes.
Birth control removes the procreative dimension,
making sex seem consequence-free and casual.
This affects more than just reproduction -
it subtly shifts how we view intimate relationships themselves.
When procreation is deliberately excluded,
the unitive purpose is also weakened.
After all, why commit deeply to someone when the relationship
is deliberatly kept from reaching its full potential?
Similarly, pornography and widespread masturbation separate sexual pleasure
entirely from human connection,
traning us to view satisfaction as something achievable alone,
focused purely on physical sensation.</p>
<p>With both purposes stripped away, sex becomes merely about pleasure -
and this reduction profoundly changes us.
We begin viewing potential partners not as persons
to share life's greatest adventures with,
but as means to physical gratification.
The sacred aspects of sexual union fade into irrelevance while
immediate satisfaction takes center stage.
We see the effects in declining relationship formation among Gen Z -
<a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/commentary/gen-zs-romance-gap-why-nearly-half-of-young-men-arent-dating/">44% of Gen Z men today report having no relationship experience at all during their teen years</a>.
The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29fd9b5c-2f35-41bf-9d4c-994db4e12998">political</a> and
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/28/young-men-women-divided-politics-religion">social</a>
divide between men and women grows wider.
When intimate relationships become primarily about personal pleasure
rather than mutual giving and shared purpose,
we lose our ability to truly understand and connect with each other.</p>
<p>The path forward requires recognizing what we've lost
in reducing intimate relationships to mere pleasure-seeking.
When we disconnect physical intimacy from its true purposes,
we don't just change how we behave -
we change how we see each other and ourselves.
Healing the growing distance between men and women requires
discovering the fuller meaning of intimate relationships and
learning again to view each other not as instruments of pleasure,
but as whole persons capable of creating something beautiful together.</p>

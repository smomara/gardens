        <h1>Get Off The Tracks</h1>
<p>Picture a heavy wagon rolling down a muddy road.
Deep ruts have been carved into the earth by countless journeys before.
The wagon naturally falls into these existing tracks,
following the path of least resistance.
Even if we wish to turn in a new direction,
the weight of the wagon and the depths of these ruts fight against us.</p>
<p>Our habits and patterns of behavior are like these tracks.
Whether formed by sin, weakness, or simple routine,
<a href="we-are-known-by-our-actions.html">they become deeply worn paths in our character</a>.
When temptation arrives,
we often find ourselves sliding into familiar grooves of response -
anger, despair, indulgence.</p>
<p>Breaking free requires immense effort.
We must heave against the full weight of habit,
pulling ourselves out of these comfortable ruts.
This moment of decision - of choosing to wrench ourselves onto a new path -
demands more strength than any other.
Yet once we've broken free, maintaining our new course becomes easier.
Each time we resist falling into old tracks,
we gradually form new paths, better paths.</p>
<p>The key is recognizing these critical moments
when we're about to fall into familiar patterns.
Then we must summon the strength, through prayer and will,
to make that decisive turn.
The effort may feel monumental,
but the freedom on the other side is worth every ounce of struggle.</p>

        <h1>We Are Known By Our Actions</h1>
<p>There's a dangerous disconnect that can grow between who we think we are
and who our actions reveal us to be.
We might carry an image of ourselves as kind, honest, or disciplined,
while our actual behavior tells a different story.</p>
<p>I once heard a professor describe students caught cheating who would plead,
&quot;Trust me, I'm not that type of person.&quot;
But they had cheated - they were exactly that type of person.
Their actions defined them more truly than their self-image.</p>
<p>We are not who we imagine ourselves to be in our minds.
We are not our intentions, our aspirations, or our excuses.
We are, simply and inescapably, what we do.
Our relationships are shaped not by our inner narrative
but by our actual treatment of others,
as <a href="humans-not-humanity.html">St. Francis knew so well</a>.
Our character is formed not by our self-concept
but by our <a href="built-on-choices.html">choices</a>
Our life is built not from our plans but from our actions.</p>
<p>This truth can be uncomfortable, but it is also liberating.
It cuts through self-deception and calls us to radical honesty.
If we don't like who we are, we must change what we do,
not just how we think about ourselves.
Every action either <a href="get-off-the-tracks.html">reinforces who we are or begins to shape who we might become</a>.</p>
<p>The path to growth starts with accepting this reality:
<a href="a-good-tree.html">we are known by our fruits</a>, not our intentions.
Our actions tell the truth about us,
even when we try to tell ourselves a different story.</p>

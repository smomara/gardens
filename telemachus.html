        <h1>Chapter 1: Telemachus</h1>
<h2>Martello Tower Scene</h2>
<p>The interaction between Buck and Stephen reveals two contrasting
approaches to institutional oppression.
Characterized by open rebellion, Buck repeatedly and openly mocks the Catholic Church,
profaning its rituals with a sharp, performative irreverence.
He also openly expresses his dislike for Haines and the English presence to Stephen.
However, this very performativity raises questions about the sincerity
and impact of his rebellion.
While Buck portrays himself as a defiant free spirit,
his willingness to feign respect for Haines in exchange
for financial benefit undermines his stance.
This transactional approach suggests that Buck’s rebellion
is less about genuine resistance to power structures
and more about self-serving opportunism.</p>
<p>Buck’s mockery of the Church, while audacious, risks being shallow
because it does not translate into any substantive challenge to the systems he derides.
By maintaining a practical relationship with Haines,
despite his professed disdain for English colonial presence,
Buck demonstrates a pragmatic adaptability that
prioritizes personal gain over ideological consistency.
This willingness to exploit institutions and individuals for his own benefit
reflects a fundamentally compromised rebellion,
one that is performative rather than transformative.</p>
<p>Stephen, by contrast, embodies a more complex relationship with power structures.
His refusal to pray for his mother suggests a deep-seated disdain,
yet he remains fundamentally connected to the Catholic Church.
While aware of his servitude to both the Church and the English,
Stephen lacks Buck's bold defiance.
Instead, he maintains a deferential attitude -
showing a reserved respect toward Haines and carrying a profound sense of Catholic guilt.</p>
<p>Stephen appears fully conscious of his own subjugation,
torn between a desire to rebel and a deeply ingrained tendency to comply.
Unlike Buck's outright mockery, Stephen's resistance is internal and conflicted.
He recognizes the systems of control binding him -
the &quot;two masters&quot; of Church and colonial power -
but has not found the courage or means to completely break free.
His is a rebellion of awareness rather than action,
marked by an acute sensitivity to his own psychological and cultural constraints.</p>
<h2>School Scene</h2>
<p>Stephen's interaction with Sargent reveals a moment of unexpected empathy.
When Stephen sees Sargent as &quot;graceless,&quot;
he recognizes something of his own past struggles.
This suggests Stephen felt like an outsider as a child,
someone who didn't quite fit in with his peers.
He seems to still carry this sense of being different and disconnected.</p>
<p>His disconnection manifests across multiple relationships:
He was disconnected when his mother died, being unable to pray for her.
He is disconnected from Buck, clearly disagreeing with his profanity
and the hurtful things Buck says about his mother, yet he does not stand up for himself.
He is disconnected from Haines,
resenting the English presence while maintaining a quiet, deferential attitude.</p>
<p>Overall, Stephen's values and actions do not align, creating a massive internal disconnect.
Joyce's narrative style brilliantly captures this internal disconnect.
By suddenly inserting Stephen's internal thoughts, visions, and reflections
in the midst of external dialogue and action,
Joyce allows readers to experience Stephen's psychological fragmentation directly.
These unexpected intrusions disrupt the narrative flow,
mirroring Stephen's own inability to align his rich inner life with external reality.
We lose ourselves in Stephen's thoughts,
feeling his profound sense of loneliness and alienation,
experiencing the very disconnect that defines his character.</p>
<p>Stephen's conversation with Mr. Deasy further illuminates his complex relationship
with colonial power structures.
Deasy represents an older generation that has thoroughly internalized colonial thinking,
sympathizing with England while looking down on the Irish.
He speaks about economic failures as if they are inherent to Irish identity,
reflecting the classic colonialist perspective of cultural and economic superiority.</p>
<p>Deasy's complains about Jews &quot;taking over&quot; become deeply ironic
given the English colonial occupation of Ireland.
His prejudiced views expose the fundamental hypocrisy of colonial thinking -
criticizing others for supposedly taking over
while being part of a system that has literally conquered and controlled another nation.</p>
<p>Stephen's response embodies his characteristic internal resistance.
His subtle comment about merchants being &quot;gentile or not&quot;
is a sharp, understated critique of Deasy's colonial and anti-Semitic worldview.</p>
<p>This interaction represents another manifestation of Stephen's central conflict:
he is acutely aware of the systems of power that constrain him,
yet feels unable to fully challenge them.
Like in the Martello Tower scene, Stephen demonstrates
a rebellion that is more intellectual than active,
a critique that exists primarily in his internal landscape
rather than in any concrete act of resistance.</p>
<p>The conversation with Deasy thus becomes another powerful example
of Stephen's profound disconnection -
understanding the mechanisms of oppression
while feeling powerless to fundamentally transform them.</p>

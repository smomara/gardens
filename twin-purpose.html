        <h1>Sex's Twin Purpose</h1>
<p>We can understand sex's fundamental purposes by examining its
natural function and inherent structure.
The objection &quot;why does it feel so good?&quot; actually reinforces this understanding -
the intense pleasure exists precisely to ensure we engage in an act essential
for human survival and to bond partners together for child-rearing.
The assymetry between male and female fertility
(men's ability to father many children versus women's nine-month pregnancy)
further supports this -
it creates a natural pressure toward committed relationships,
as women's limited fertility and vulnerability during pregnancy
pressures women to choose devoted partners for optimal outcomes.
This isn't a design flaw but a feature that promotes stable family formation.</p>
<p>A popular analogy is one to eating.
Critics often suggest pleasure could be an equal purpose rather than
a means to deeper ends.
But this analogy actually supports the natural law view -
we eat because we must survive,
and the pleasure of eating exists to ensure we do it.
Similarly, the humna species must reproduce to survive,
and sexual pleasure exists to ensure we do that too.
The key difference is that eating is individual while sex is inherently relational,
oriented toward both creating new life and bonding partners in that creative endeavor.
The pleasure serves these purposes rather than existing as an end in itself,
just as hunger serves nutrition rather than being its own purpose.
That we can artifically separate pleasure from these natural ends
doesn't change their fundamental connection.</p>

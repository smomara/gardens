        <h1>A Good Tree</h1>
<p>&quot;A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.&quot;
Christ's words cut through all self-deception with their simple truth.
Just as a tree is known by its fruit, we are known by our actions.
No amount of intentions, promises, or self-image can change this fundamental reality.
An apple tree produces apples - it cannot do otherwise.
So too do our hearts produce actions that reveal their true nature.</p>
<p>The encouraging flip side of this truth is that genuine inner transformation
will inevitably show itself in our actions.
When we allow God to change our hearts, good fruit naturally follows.
We need not force it or fake it.
Like a healthy tree drawing life from deep roots,
a heart rooted in Christ naturally bears the fruit of
faith, hope, charity, and all other virtues.
And like the tiny <a href="the-kingdoms-seed.html">mustard seed</a> that grows into a mighty tree,
this transformation often starts small but gradually produces abundance beyond measure.</p>

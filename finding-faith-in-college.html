        <h1>Finding Faith In College</h1>
<p>When I arrived at The Catholic University of America,
I was Catholic in name only.
Though baptized, faith had been more of a family tradition than personal conviction -
something done rather than something lived.</p>
<p>I spend most of my life keeping God at arm's length,
driven by a mixture of fear, pride, and uncertainty.
Like many young people, I reacted defensively to authority and direction.
How ironic that I let this rebellious spirit keep me
from the very source of true freedom.
Yet God is patient, and sometimes He <a href="the-kingdoms-seed.html">plants</a> us exactly where we need to grow.</p>
<p>At Catholic U, I found myself surrounded by people who lived their faith authentically.
Through countless conversations and question, I began to recognize a deeper yearning -
I wasn't looking for simple answers, but for God Himself.
What I thought was intellectual curiosity was actually
a soul's deep yearning for its Creator.
The walls of pride began to crumble as I realized that submitting to God wasn't
losing myself, but finding who I was meant to be.</p>
<p>At the time I write this, I'm in OCIA at the university.</p>
<p>This is just be beginning of my journey home to the Church,
but already I can see how God used my time here to draw me closer to him.</p>
